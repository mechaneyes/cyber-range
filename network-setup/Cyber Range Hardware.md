# Upgrades eminent

2 packs of 32BG RAM upgrades on the way. Security Onion which I'll be using for defense on both the cyber range and in production will perform much better with that memory ceiling raised.




# Networking

## Router

To perform packet capture, leverage a switch that can perform port mirroring.

The switch or router can utilize port mirroring to send copies of network packets viewed on one set of specified ports (source ports) to other sets of specified ports (destination ports).

This is used to transmit traffic to programs that analyze traffic for things like monitoring compliance, enforcing rules, discovering intrusions, and other things.

## Firewall

You have a lot of options here. Nothing fancy is needed. It just needs to be solid in order to protect you production/home network.

I had another Mikrotik device that worked perfectly. It's cheap, and also easy to leverage as I've gained familiarity with it that can easily be applied to working with the beefier router above.
